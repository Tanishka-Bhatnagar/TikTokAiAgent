# TikTokAiAgent
Assessment by SoluLabs

AI-powered conversational agent for creating TikTok ad campaigns through natural language. Built for AI Engineer assessment focusing on prompt design, API reasoning, and intelligent error handling.

## What It Does

Guides users through ad creation conversationally:
1. **Campaign Name** (min 3 chars)
2. **Objective** (Traffic/Conversions)
3. **Ad Text** (max 100 chars)
4. **CTA** (Call-to-Action)
5. **Music** (3 options with conditional logic)
6. **Submission** (with OAuth & error handling)

## Technical Stack
- **Language**: Python 3.8+
- **LLM**: Google Gemini (gemini-2.5-flash)
- **APIs**: Mocked (TikTok, OAuth, Music)
- **Architecture**: State machine pattern

I have used mock APIs because TikTok is banned in India. So no developer access is allowed.
Used Gemini for fast response time and free tire for development.
